GENHK:
Junior Data Engineer Programme - Final Project 
Project Description	Olist Store is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. The Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders (from 2016 to 2018) made at Olist Store is provided to your company for analysis.
Your manager is asking you to critically analyse the provided datasets using Business Intelligence tools and provide some marketing findings / recommendations in a report format. The dataset has information of 100k orders made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. A geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates is also integrated in the dataset.
After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store, a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where they can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
The dataset is available here (please download the ZIP file)
1. Data Schema
The data is divided into multiple datasets for better understanding and organization. Please refer to the following data schema when working with it:

 
2. Attention
1.	An order might have multiple items.
2.	Each item might be fulfilled by a distinct seller.


3. Possible scopes of the marketing findings / recommendations from the dataset:
1.	Feedback Sentiment Analysis: Evaluate the polarity of the tweets as customer feedback positive, negative or neutral.
2.	Clustering: Some customers did not write a review. But why are they happy or mad?
3.	Sales Prediction: With purchase date information you will be able to predict future sales.
4.	Delivery Performance: You will also be able to work through delivery performance and find ways to optimize delivery times.

Project Objectives	1.	Create data pipeline to ingest data in PostgreSQL or SQL server database
2.	Use Power BI to answer following questions:
a.	How many customers, orders, and orders per customer does the company have?
b.	What is the number of customers by state?
c.	What is the number of orders by month?
d.	What are the top 5 product categories?
3.	Visualise the company’s customers’ demographics, sales trend, orders by categories, orders changes by year, etc. and use Power BI to help make better decisions
4.	Map and compare report data with data from database query to validate the reports (functional testing).
5.	Critically analyse relevant data using statistical methods (e.g., Predictive Modelling or Machine Learning)
6.	Provide some recommendations and improvements (please refer to point 3 in the project description)
BSM	All (see BSM Evaluation Rubric)

●	The Power BI Desktop source file or the published Power BI dashboard URL	●	A user guide about how the dashboard works, e.g., what’s the meaning & relations of visuals, slicers, etc.
●	Dashboard

2.	Presentation slides
○	Guide: Guidelines to Create a Presentation Deck

Presentation	●	Time is allocated for presentation prep and rehearsal before the actual presentation.
○	Guide: Tips to Deliver a Presentation  
●	Each team will take turns to present the completed project to an assessment panel.
●	Final team presentation will take place in the final week of the program. 
●	Potential employers may be invited on the presentation day. 
Assessment 	●	Formative Assessment of Project Deliverables - 
○	Specific qualitative feedback will be provided by instructor(s) for each team’s performance (technical)/ deliverables throughout all phases.
■	Download to fill up and submit this Deliverables Checklist at the end of each project phrase: 
○	Team score will be given for presentation based on a rubric.
■	Presentation evaluation rubric
●	Peer Assessment - Participants will assess their team members’ BSM and collaboration in the project. 
○	Download to fill up and submit this Peer Assessment BSM Form by the end of the project. 
●	Self-Reflection - Participants will complete a self-reflection form to self-assess how they have demonstrated BSM in their project teams. 
○	Download to fill up and submit this Self-Assessment BSM Form by the end of the project.
